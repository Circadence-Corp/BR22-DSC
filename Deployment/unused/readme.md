# Explanation

Files in this directory are not used in the main deployment (azuredeploy.json). 

They may be used for other ad-hoc purposes, such as ad-hoc needs. 

They could also be leftover artifacts from the repos from which this was forked, in which case they should be removed once confirmed as unnecessary.
